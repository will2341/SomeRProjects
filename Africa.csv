Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,1,I hear the drums echoing tonight
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,2,But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,3,"She's coming in, 12:30 flight"
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,4,The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,5,I stopped an old man along the way
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,6,Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,7,He turned to me as if to say
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,8,"""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"""
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,9,It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,10,There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,11,I bless the rains down in Africa
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,12,Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,13,The wild dogs cry out in the night
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,14,As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,15,I know that I must do what's right
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,16,As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,17,I seek to cure what's deep inside
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,18,Frightened of this thing that I've become
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,19,It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,20,There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,21,I bless the rains down in Africa
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,22,Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,23,"Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you"
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,24,It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,25,There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,26,I bless the rains down in Africa
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,27,I bless the rains down in Africa
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,28,I bless the rains down in Africa
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,29,I bless the rains down in Africa
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,30,I bless the rains down in Africa
Toto,Toto IV,Africa,10,31,Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
